# string_switch_statement
example of using strings with switch statments in C++ (spdlogging included)

1. Open this repo in you favorite c++ editor (I made this project in Visual Studio, but it's a CMake console application so it should work with other IDEs like CLion)
2. Click run and the C++ console should pop up
3. Enter "yes" or "no" to see the output. 

Note: to see a demo of the `spdlog` library, type a input other than "yes" or "no" and see the proper error log.
